## üõ£Ô∏è Next Steps / Roadmap

This project provides a strong foundation, and I plan to build upon it in future learning iterations:

* **Add JavaScript:** Incorporate JavaScript for dynamic, real-time form validation and error handling.
* **Backend Integration:** In a later project, store form responses using a simple backend (e.g., Node.js and Express).
* **Aesthetic Polish:** Refine the CSS with a focus on modern typography and subtle animations.
